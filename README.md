## Chapter 1: The data Aa

# Data Analytics
Domain of data analytics can be branched into two primary components:
* conceptual understanding of data (theoretical aspect)
* Hands-on manipulation of data (practical aspect)

* The aim is to extract actionable insights and valuable information from data
* What to understand under the Module:
  - Understand what the role of a data analyst is and the scope of data analytics
  - Compare and contrast different data types
  - Compare and contrast common data structures and file formats
  - Learner Assumptions

# What is Data Analytics
so virtually every organization collects large quantities of data about its customers,products,employees and service offerings
* Managers naturally seek to analyze that data and harness the information it contains to improve the efficiency ,effectiveness and profitability of their work>
* So what is the role of a data analyst ,is to **transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making process within the organization**

## 1. Data Collection and Preparation:

* Sourcing Data from various channels,including databases ,spreadsheets and eternal sources
* Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it is accurate consistent and ready for analysis

## 2. Data Analysis
* Employing statistical methods,machine learning techniques ,or other analytic tools to interpret data
* Identifying trends,patterns ,and correlations that might not be obvious

## 3. Data Visualization and Storytelling:
* having to create visual representations of the data,such as charts,graphs and dashboards to make complex information easily understandable
* Articulating findings in a compelling narrative to communicate the significance of data to stakeholders.

## 4. Decision Support
*Making recommendations based on data driven insights to help guide business decisions
* Providing more context around data, including potential implications and future trends.

## 5. Collaboration and Communication
* Working closely with other departments,such as **marketing** ,**finance and operations**,to understand their data needs and provide insights
* Adapting to new types of data and analytical methods as the organization's needs evolve.

A data analyst helps an organization make informed decisions that can improve operational efficiencies ,drive business strategies ,and create a competitive advantage.Goal is to contribute to the organization's success by turning data into valuable assets that informs and drives decision making

* Data analyst posses skills and knowledge required to perform this vital work
  - They often understand how organization can acquire,clean,and transform data to meet the organization's needs.
  - They are able to take the collected information and analyze it using techniques of statistics and machine learning
  - They may then create powerful visualizations that display this data to business leaders,managers and other stakeholders

 # 5 Key points of data analytics

 ### step 1
 process of analyzing raw data to produce useful insights to drive smart business decision,it is kind of business intelligence that can be used to find patterns,example how customers engage with a particualr product.
 ### Step 2 How data analytics is used
 use to make faster and better business decisons

### Step 4: Typical process of a data analyst
##### 5 steps data analyst can take when approaching a new projects

* ``Step 1: Define questions you want to answer=take problem,make hypothesis``
  - what data will I need?
  - Where will it come from?
    
* ``Step 2: Collect the data``
  - gather data from primary sources or from internal data
    - from CRM Software ,Email ,marketing tools
    - can also gather data from secondary sources or external sources
      
* ``Step 3 : Clean the Data``
  - original data might include duplicates ,anamoalies ,missing data,this must be removed
    
* ``Step 4 : Analyze the Data``
  - common analysis include:
    - Regression analysis
    - Cluster analysis
    - Time series analysis

### Three Major pillars that allow analytics progras to thrive
* Data
* Storage
* Computing power

## The analytics Process
- Analysts working with data move through a series of different steps as they seek to gain business value from their organization's data
![Screenshot 2024-04-09 105600](https://github.com/BafanaMadume/Data-analyticsweek1/assets/141032267/9a12f9f1-1010-4645-9dc0-eba382930289)

* Data acquisition
* Cleaning and manipulation
* Analysis
* Visualization
* Reporting and communication

#### Analytics  Process is iterative
Steps of the analytics process as aseries of sequential actions,it is more accurate to think of them as aset of interrelated actions that may be revisited frequently while working with a dataset

## Analytics Techniques
As analysts we use variety of techniques to draw conclusions from the data at their disposal.
- ``Descriptive Analytics``
- ``Predictive Analytics``
- ``Prescriptive analytics``

## Machine Learning,Artificial Intelligence,and Deep Learning
* Work of analytics is intellectually and computationally demanding.
* Machine Learning uses algorithms to discover knowledge in your datasets that you can then apply to help one make informed decisions about the future

**Cases Where Machine Learning Commonly adds value:**
- Segmenting customers and determining the marketing messages that will appeal to different customer groups.
- Discovering anomalies in system and application logs that may be indicative of a cybersecurity incident
- Forecasting product sales based on market and environmental conditions

* ``Artificial Intelligence(AI)`` includes any type of technique whee you are attempting to get a compuer system to imitate human behavior
* ``Machine Learning(ML)`` is a subset of AI techniques,ML techniques attempt to apply statistics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge,ML techniques are AI techniques designed to learn.
* ``Deep Learning`` is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques,known as neural networks ,it is a highly specialized subfield of machine learning that is most commonly used for image and sound analysis.

## DATA GOVERNANCE
Data Governance programs ensure that the organization has high-quality data and is able to effectively control that data

## ANALYTICS TOOLS
These tools automate much of the heavy lifting of data analysis,improving the analyst's ability to
* **``acquire``**
* **``clean``**
* **``manipulate``**
* **``visualize and analyze data``**
* **``Invaluable assistance in reporting and communicating results``**

# Chapter 2: Understanding Data
## Exploring Data Types 

* Data element is an attribute about a person,place ,or thing containing data within a range of values.Data elements also describe characteristics of activities ,including orders ,transactions and events.,the column headings name the data element ,while each row is an example value for that format
* Data type limits the values a data element can have ,individual data types support structured,unstructured and semi-structured data

* **1 Tabular Data**
  - tabular data is data organized into a table,made up of columns and rows .a table represents information about a single topic
  - Each **``column``** represents a uniquely named field within a table,also called a variable,about a single characteristics,contents of each column contain values for the data element as defined by the column header
  - Each **``row``** represents a record of a single instance of the table's topic
* Tabular data as rectangular ,meaning it is easier to to draw a rectangle around.top of the rectangle is defined by columns,while rows define the left side of the rectangle,and the intersection of a row and colum contains a specific value.
* Microsoft Excel ,google sheets, and apple numbers are practical tools for presenting tabular data
* Relational Database management system(RDMS), commonly called a database extends the tabular model wherby instead of having all data in a single table,a database organisez related data across multiple tables
* Instead of having all data in a single table,a database organizes related data across multiple tables
* The connection between tables is known as a relationship.Oracle,Microsoft SQL server,MySQL, and PostgreSQL are some examples of database software
* Tabular data is the concept that underpins both spreadsheets and relational databases

## STRUCTURED DATA TYPES
* Structured data is tabular in nature and is organized into rows and columns,Structured data is what typically comes to mind when looking at a spreadsheet
* Structured data is what typically comes to mind when looking at a spreadsheet.With clearly defined columnn,headings,spreadsheets are easy to work with and easy to understand,so in a spreadsheet cells are where rows and colums intersect.

## Common Data Types that give structured data its structure 

## Character
character data type limits data entry to only valid characters .Characters can include the alphabet that you might see on your keyboard,as well as numbers.So depending on your needs multiple data types are available that can enforce character limits

* **ALPHANUMERIC** is the most widely used data type for strong character based data,alphanumeric is appropriate when a data element consists of both numbers and letters
* Alphanumeric data type is ideal for storing product stock-keeping units (SKUs),skus are common for retail clothing space
* one practical use of the text data type is to improve the overall data quality

![Screenshot 2024-04-09 153302](https://github.com/BafanaMadume/Data-analyticsweek1/assets/141032267/7f802c20-9ec6-48a4-8756-56e8aa94fe99)

## Character Sets
* We need to think about the character set we are using to input and store data when using a database.
* **Database use character sets to map,or encode,data and store it digitally**
* The ASCII encoding standard is based on the U.S English alphabet,it accommodates both the upper and lowercase English alphabet and numbers,mathematical operators and symbols
* one of the most commonis unicode Transormation Format-8(UTF-8), it allows non latin characters to be input by a user and stored in a file or database

## DATA TYPE
#### NUMBERS
* When numbers exclusively make up values for a data attribute,numeric becomes the data type of choice
* This data type appears to be simple and obvious based on its name.
* Databases accommodate two types of numeric data types:integar and numeric.

#### Whole Numbers
* The integar and all its subtypes are for storing whole numbers
* The bit data type is intended for storing the status of a flag.

#### Rational Numbers
* The numeric data type is for rational numbers that include a decimal point.
* As with integar family of data types,each database vendor has its implementation nuances
* must take several factors into account when dealing with rational numbers.in both SQL Server and MySQL,there is a data type called numeric that is functionally equivalent to the decimal data type.

#### Date and Time
* Gathered together under the broad category of date,day of year and time of day are data elements that appear with great frequency
![Screenshot 2024-04-09 155648](https://github.com/BafanaMadume/Data-analyticsweek1/assets/141032267/c11885dd-4420-4782-ba73-f6da01f04316)

## Strong and Weak Typing
* Data Types define values placed in columns,Strong typing is when technology rigidly enforces data types.A database column defined as numeric only accepts numerical values
* Weak Typing loosely enforces data types ,spreadsheets use weak typing to help make it easier for people to finish their work,
* Spreadsheets default to an "automatic" data type and accommodate practically any value
---

# Unstructured data TYPES
* UNSTRUCTURED DATA is any type of data that does not fit neatly into the tabular model
* Examples of unstructured data include:
  - Digital images
  - audio recordings
  - video recordings
  - open-ended survey responses
* Analyzing unstructured data creates a wealth of information and insight.
* Unstructured data type:
* **``Binary``**
  - most common data types for storing unstructure data.It supports any type of digital file you may have Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to digital photographs.
  - When considering which binary data type to use ,file size tends to be the limiting factor.
  - We need to select a data type that is as large as the largest file you plan on storing

* **``Audio``**
  - it can come from variety of sources
  - The impact of capturing,storing,and analyzing audio data has led to the development of avalanche detection systems,These systems listen for and detect the acoustic characteristics of an avalanche,with real time notification capabilities,these systems reduces time it takes for emergency services to respond and alert hikers to treacherous condition
  - Audio can be stored in its raw form which consumes most storage space.
  - alternatively it can be encoded with compression algorithm to reduce the amount of space that is required
  - Regardless of it it is in raw or compressed form,storing audio requires a data type designed to handle raw binary data
* **``Images``**
  - image data has applicability across several industries.
  - Resolution is the most significant factor that governs how much space is required to store an image.The greater the resolution the more detail an image contains,and the more storage space it needs
  - Similar to compressing audio data ,there are a variety of ways to encode and store images
  - Storing images in a database requires a data type designed to handle raw binary data such as varbinary or BLOB
* **``Video``**
  - Video data is growing at a similar pace to image data,image processing algorithms examine videos to detect everything from traffic congestion to intruders in the home.
  - Audio data,the resolution has a significant impact on storage a video consumes.Video duration is also another factor that impacts storage size.
* **``Large Text``**
  -oracle currently implents varchar as a synonym for varchar2

# CATEGORIES OF DATA
Semi-structured data represents the space between structured spreadsheets and unstructured videos

### Quantitative vs Qualitative Data
  - Quantitative data consists of numeric values,Data elements whose values come from counting or measuring are Quantitative
  - Quantitative data answers question like "How Many" and "How Much"
  - Qualitative data consists of frequent text values.Data elements whose values describe characteristics,traits and attitudes are all qualitative.

### DISCRETE VS CONTINUOUS DATA
- Numeric data comes in two different forms:discrete and continuous.
- Discrete data is data that represents measurements that can't be subdivided.discrete data is useful when you have things you want to count.
- It's typically represented with bar graphs where each bar represents a specific coun
- When you measure things like height and weight,you are collecting continuous data.
- While whole numbers represent discrete data ,continuous data typically need a decimal point.
- Qualitative data is discrete,but quantitative data can be either discrete or continuous data
- Discrete applies when counting while continuous applies when measuring.
- It's typically visualized with line graphs or histograms, where the line or bars connect smoothly to show the 
  range of possible values
### CATEGORICAL DATA
- Text data with a known ,finite number of categories is categorical,When considering an individual data element.it is possible to determine whether or not it is categorical
- Categorical data, also known as qualitative data, is a different breed compared to discrete and continuous 
  data. It doesn't deal with numbers representing quantities, but rather categorizes things based on qualities 
  or labels
- You can also use categories to enforce data validation when someone is first entering data.
- Category enforcement has the effect of improving data quality

### DIMENSIANAL DATA
- Dimensional modeling is an approach to arranging data to facilitate analysis
- Dimensional modeling organizes data into fact tables and dimension tables
- A table holding appointment data would be called a fact table
- Dimensions are tables that contain data about the fact
- Dimensional data contains groupings of individual attributes about a given subject.

## Common Data Structures
data needs to be stored in a consistent ,organized manner.

#### Structured Data
- Tabular data is structured data ,with values stored in a consistent ,defined manner,it is organized into columns and rows.
- Data is consistent when all entries in a column contain the same type of value(this particular method of organization facilitates aggregation)
- Structured data also make summarization easy.
- Structured data does not translate directly to data quality

#### UNSTRUCTURED DATA
Unstructured data is qualitative ,describing the characteristics of an event or an object.**Images ,phrases,audio or video recording and descriptive text.** are all examples of unstructured data.
* unstructured data also represents a significant opportunity.
* Machine data is a common source of unstructured data.Machine data has various sources including internet of things devices,smartphones,tablets,personal computers and servers
* The key-value concept underpins the design of object storage.The key becomes unique identifier and the value is the unstructured data itself
* To access the contents of a file ,you need to know its key

#### SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA
* is data that has structure and that is not tabular.
* Email is an example of semi structured formatting options.These formatting options use seprators or tags to 
  provide context aroud a data element

---
## Common File Formats

## Text Files
A text file is a basic type of computer file that stores information as plain text. This means it contains only letters, numbers, symbols, and some basic formatting characters like newline breaks
Text files are one of the the most commomly used data file formats.
* They consist of plain text and are limited in scope to alphanumeric data
* Reasons text files are so widely adopted is their ability to be opened regardless of platform or operating system without needing a proprietary piece of software.
* When machines generates data ,the output is commonly stored in a text file
* A unique character known as ``delimiter`` facilitates transmitting structured data via a text file,delimiter is the character that separates individual fields
* Delimiter can be any character
* when a file is comma-delimiited ,it is known as a **COMMA-SEPRATED VALUES**
* When a file is tab-delimited it is called a tab-separated values(TSV)

## Fixed-width Files
* Fixed width files are more laborious to create since they require a few extra steps

## JavaScript Object Notation
* Javascript Object Notation(JSON) is an open standard file format, designed to add structure to a text file 
  without incurring significant overhead.
* json is easily readable by people and easily parsed by modern programming languages
* Python ,R and Go have libraries containing functions that facilitate reading and writing JSON files.

## Extensible Markup Language (XML)
Is a markup language that facilitates structuring data in a text file
* XML incurs more overhead because it makes extensive use of tags. Tags describe a data element and enclose each value for each data element.
* Tags help readability ,they add a significant amount of overhead
* XML was the data format of choice and facilitated Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax) web development techniques.

## HyperText Makruo Language (HTML)
*  is a markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
*  HTML pages serve as the foundation for how people interact with the World Wide Web. Similar to XML, HTML is a tag-based language.

  # Module 2 : Data preparation and Exploration

  # Chapter 3
- Data Concepts and Environments
- Identify basic concepts of data schemas and dimesions
- Understanding the domain of data Mining
- explain data acquisition concepts
- Explain common techniques for data manipulation and query optimization

  ## EXPLORING DATABASES
  * TWo categories
  * 1.Relational
  * 2.Nonrelational

  Databases fall into two categories,many of the systems we interact with daily produce tabular data .this is because tabular data is highly structured ,

### The Relational Model
* IBM's Edgar F.codd developed the relational model for database management,it builds on the concept of tabular data

# Relational Database

![Screenshot 2024-04-11 092350](https://github.com/BafanaMadume/Data-analyticsweek1/assets/141032267/49f915d0-872c-4dcd-8f66-bf6c7fc799d9)
* Understanding that the header corresponds to the name of an entity.
* Each row represents an individual attribute associated with a person.
* Each of these entities becomes a separate table in the database,with a column for each attribute
* Each row represents an instance of the entity
* The power of the relational model is that it also allows us to describe how entities connect or relate ,to each other

#### Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD)
* it is a visual artifact of the data modeling process.
* it shows  the connection between related entities
* A relationship is a connection between entities
* Cardinality refers to the relationship between two entities,showing how many instance of entity relate to instance in another entity.
* We specify cardinality in an ERD with various line endings
* 1st Component of the terminator indicates whether the relationship between two entities is optional or required
* 2nd Component indicates whether an entity instance in the first table is associated with a single entity instance in the related table or if an association can exist with multiple entity instances.

![Screenshot 2024-04-11 094114](https://github.com/BafanaMadume/Data-analyticsweek1/assets/141032267/0c7fbed9-089e-4f8b-8e7a-328f3bc60e2d).

* Unary Relationship is when an entity has a connection with itself
* Binary Relationship connects two entities
* Ternary Relationship connects three entities

Binary relationship are most common and easy to explore ,whereas unary and ternary are comparatively complex and rare
* The ability to read ERD's helps you understand the structure of a relational database
* ERDS are useful when formulating how to retrieve information from the data that is spread across multiple tables ,becausethe diagrams allow you to visualizw the connections between entities.

## RELATIONAL DATABASES
Relational databses are pieces of software that let you make an operational system out of an ERD.
* Start with relational model and create a physical design
* Relational entities correspond to database tables ,and entity attributes corresponds to table columns
* When creating a database table ,the ordering of columns does not matter because you can specify the column order when retrieving data from a table
* When an attribute becomes a column ,you assign it a data type
* Schema as an ERD with the additional details needed to create a database

![Screenshot 2024-04-11 100607](https://github.com/BafanaMadume/Data-analyticsweek1/assets/141032267/1a3dee67-18da-43b3-8b5f-7cf4256f986b)

* An associative table is both a table and a relationship.
* An associative table lets us identify the relationship between a specific animal and a particular person with a minimun amount of data duplication.

* A **``Primary key``** is one or more attributes that uniquely identify a specific row in a table
* Synthethis primary key is an attribute whose only purpose is to contain unique values for each row in the table
* Foreign key is one or more columns in one table that points to corresponding columns in a related table
* A foreign key reference another table's primary.
* Every row in a relational database must be unique
* To pull data from a relational database table,you perform a query,we compose queries using a programming language called **Structured Query Language(SQL)**

### Relational Database Providers
* Oracle is one of the most mature databse platforms
* Microsoft developed SQL  Server and the open source community created offerings including MySQL,MariaDB and PostgreSQL .Amazon Web Services (AWS) developed Aurora
* Aurora is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL,Aurora is unique because it takes advantage of AWS's underlying cloud platform and is easy to scale


## NONRELATIONAL DATABASES
a nonrelational database does not have a predefined structure based on tabular data.result is a highly flexible approach to storing data.the Data types available in relational databases are absent.

## EXAMPLES OF NONRELATIONAL DATABASE
* it includeas key-value,document,column family and graph.

 ### KEY-VALUE
 -  database is one of the simplest ways of storing data,data is stored as a collection of keys and their corresponding values
 - A key must be globally unique across the entire database.The use of keys differs from a relational database,where a given key identifies an individual row in a specific table
 - There are no structural limits on the values of a key.
 - A key can be a sequence of numbers,alphanumeric strings or some other combination of values,
 - Data that corresponds with the key can be any structured or unstructured data type
 -  One reason for choosing a key-value database is when you have lots of data and can search by a key's value.

### DOCUMENT

* A document database is similar to key-value database ,with additional restrictions in a key-value data,the 
  value can contain anything.
* with document database the value is restricted to a specific structured format
* With a known, structured format, document databases have additional flexibility beyond what is possible with key-value.
*  The document key is the profile name.

### Column Family
* Column-family databases use an index to identify data in groups of related columns.
* This design facilitates distributing data across multiple machines, which enables handling massive amounts of data
* The ability to handle large data volumes is due to the technical implementation details of how these databases organize and store
* column-family databases optimize performance when you need to examine the contents of a column across many rows. The main reason for choosing a column-family database is its ability to scale

### Graph
* Graph databases specialize in exploring relationships between pieces of data.
* Relational models focus on mapping the relationships between entities. Graph models map relationships between actual pieces of data.

# DATABASE USE CASES
transactional and reporting systems need different implementation approaches to serve the people who use them efficiently
* Databases tend to support two major categories of data processing:``Online Transactional Processing(OLTP)`` and `` Online Analytical processing(OLAP)``

## ONLINE TRANSACTIONAL PROCESSING

* OLTP  systems handle the transactions we encounter everyday,e.g transactions include booking a flight reservation,ordering something online.or executing  A STOCK TRADE
* While a number of transactions a system handles on a given day can be high,individual transactions process small amounts of data
* OLTP systems balance the ability to write and read data efficiently

# Normalization
Description = Normalization is a process for structuring a database in a way that minimizes duplication iof data

* one of the principles is that a given piece of data is stored once and only once,
* Normalized database is ideal for processing transactions.

### First normal form(1NF)
*  is when every row in a table is unique and every column contains a unique value.
![Screenshot 2024-04-11 133031](https://github.com/BafanaMadume/Data-analyticsweek1/assets/141032267/12c1185f-bfde-420f-ae0c-6d59caa1868f)

### Secod normal form(2NF)
starts when 1NF leaves off.in addition to each row being unique,2nf applies an additional rule stating that all nonprimary key values must depend on the entire primary key
* it eliminates partial dependencies:a partial dependency occurs when a non-key attribute ,which is an attribute not part of the primary key) it relies on only part of the primary ,not the entire key to determine its value
 ![Screenshot 2024-04-11 134152](https://github.com/BafanaMadume/Data-analyticsweek1/assets/141032267/2f1eaf41-5235-4085-95a6-85cfd59ac542).

### Third normal form(3NF)
builds upon 2NF by adding a rule stating all columns must depend on only the primary key.
* A table must be in 2NF (follows the rules of 1NF and eliminates partial dependencies).
It eliminates transitive dependencies. A transitive dependency occurs when a non-key attribute (attribute not part of the primary key) relies on another non-key attribute, which in turn depends on the primary key, to determine its value
* Databases in 3NF are said to be highly normalized

---

## ONLINE ANALYTICAL PROCESSING
OLAP systems focus on the ability of organzition to analyze data.While OLAP and OLTP databases need to balance transactional read and write performance,which results in highly normalize design.Typically, OLTP databases are in 3NF 
* Databases that power OLAP systems have a denormalized design.so instead of having data distributed across multiple tables,denormalization results in wider tables than those found in an OLTP database.
* it is more efficient for analytical queries to read large amounts of data for a singe table instead of incurring the cost of joining multiple tabes together.
* The greater the number of joins ,the more complex the query .The more complex the query ,the longer it takes to retrieve results
---
---

# Schema Concepts
* Design of a database schema depends on the purpose it serves
* transactional systems require highly normalized databaseswhereas a denormalized design is more appropriate for analytical systems
* ``Data warehouse`` is a database that aggregates data from many transactional systems for analytical purposes
* Transactional data may come from systems that power the human resources, sales ,marketing and product divisions
* A ``data warehouse`` facilitates analytics across the entire company.
* ``Data mart`` is a subset of a data warehouse,
* Data warehouses serve the entire organization and data marts focus on the needs of a particular department within the organization
* A data lake stores raw data in its native format instead of conforming to a relational database structure
* ``Data lake`` is more complex than a data warehouse or data mart ,and requires additional knowledge about the raw data to make it analytically useful
* Relational databsases enforces a structure that encapsulates business rules and business logic

#### DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DATABASES AND DATA WAREHOUSES
* Databases are designed for transactions , Data Warehouses are designed for analytics and reporting
* Databases data is fresh and detailed , Data warehouses data is refreshed periodically and summarized
* Databases work slowly for querying large amounts of data and can slow down transactional processes.Data Warehouses don't interfere with any processes and are generally faster

## Star Schema
is designed to facilitate analytical processing ,
* Star schemas are denormalized to improve read performance over large datasets
