# Data Analytics
Domain of data analytics can be branched into two primary components:
* conceptual understanding of data (theoretical aspect)
* Hands-on manipulation of data (practical aspect)

* The aim is to extract actionable insights and valuable information from data
* What to understand under the Module:
  - Understand what the role of a data analyst is and the scope of data analytics
  - Compare and contrast different data types
  - Compare and contrast common data structures and file formats
  - Learner Assumptions

# What is Data Analytics
so virtually every organization collects large quantities of data about its customers,products,employees and service offerings
* Managers naturally seek to analyze that data and harness the information it contains to improve the efficiency ,effectiveness and profitability of their work>
* So what is the role of a data analyst ,is to **transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making process within the organization**

## 1. Data Collection and Preparation:

* Sourcing Data from various channels,including databases ,spreadsheets and eternal sources
* Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it is accurate consistent and ready for analysis

## 2. Data Analysis
* Employing statistical methods,machine learning techniques ,or other analytic tools to interpret data
* Identifying trends,patterns ,and correlations that might not be obvious

## 3. Data Visualization and Storytelling:
* having to create visual representations of the data,such as charts,graphs and dashboards to make complex information easily understandable
* Articulating findings in a compelling narrative to communicate the significance of data to stakeholders.

## 4. Decision Support
*Making recommendations based on data driven insights to help guide business decisions
* Providing more context around data, including potential implications and future trends.

## 5. Collaboration and Communication
* Working closely with other departments,such as **marketing** ,**finance and operations**,to understand their data needs and provide insights
* Adapting to new types of data and analytical methods as the organization's needs evolve.

A data analyst helps an organization make informed decisions that can improve operational efficiencies ,drive business strategies ,and create a competitive advantage.Goal is to contribute to the organization's success by turning data into valuable assets that informs and drives decision making

* Data analyst posses skills and knowledge required to perform this vital work
  - They often understand how organization can acquire,clean,and transform data to meet the organization's needs.
  - They are able to take the collected information and analyze it using techniques of statistics and machine learning
  - They may then create powerful visualizations that display this data to business leaders,managers and other stakeholders

 # 5 Key points of data analytics

 ### step 1
 process of analyzing raw data to produce useful insights to drive smart business decision,it is kind of business intelligence that can be used to find patterns,example how customers engage with a particualr product.
 ### Step 2 How data analytics is used
 use to make faster and better business decisons
 - can be used to reduce overall business costs
 - Develop new and innovative products and services

* can be used to predict future sales or purchasinbg behaviours
* To help and protect against fraud
* To analyze the effectiveness of marketing campaigns
* To boost customer acquisition and retention
* To increase Supply chain Efficiency

### Step 3 What does a data Analyst do on a day to day?
#### Roles and Responsibilities
* Manage the delivery of user satisfaction surveys and report on results using data visualization software
* Work with business line owners to develop requirements ,define success metrics,manage and execute analytical projects and evaluate results
* monitor practices,processes and systems to identify opportunities for improvement
* Translate important questions into concrete analytical tasks
* Gather new data to answer client questions ,collating and organizing data from multiple sources
* Design ,Build, Test and maintain backend code
* Establish data processes,define data quality criteria,and implement data quality processes
* Work as part of a team to evaluate and analyze key data that will be used to shape future business strategies

### Step 4: Typical process of a data analyst
##### 5 steps data analyst can take when approaching a new projects

* ``Step 1: Define questions you want to answer=take problem,make hypothesis``
  - what data will I need?
  - Where will it come from?
    
* ``Step 2: Collect the data``
  - gather data from primary sources or from internal data
    - from CRM Software ,Email ,marketing tools
    - can also gather data from secondary sources or external sources
      
* ``Step 3 : Clean the Data``
  - original data might include duplicates ,anamoalies ,missing data,this must be removed
    
* ``Step 4 : Analyze the Data``
  - common analysis include:
    - Regression analysis
    - Cluster analysis
    - Time series analysis

* ``Step 5 : intepret and share results``
  - in a form of a chart or graph,and being able to say what the data analysis shows you.

### Step 5: Skills needed to become a data Analyst
- Mathematical and statistical ability
- programming knowledge on python ,oracle and SQL
- Analytical mindset
- Excellenct communication skills
 
* Business analytics is all about answering questions and solving business challenges

### Three Major pillars that allow analytics progras to thrive
* Data
* Storage
* Computing power

## The analytics Process
- Analysts working with data move through a series of different steps as they seek to gain business value from their organization's data

* Data acquisition
* Cleaning and manipulation
* Analysis
* Visualization
* Reporting and communication

#### Analytics  Process is iterative
Steps of the analytics process as aseries of sequential actions,it is more accurate to think of them as aset of interrelated actions that may be revisited frequently while working with a dataset

## Analytics Techniques
As analysts we use variety of techniques to draw conclusions from the data at their disposal.
- ``Descriptive Analytics``
- ``Predictive Analytics``
- ``Prescriptive analytics``

## Machine Learning,Artificial Intelligence,and Deep Learning
* Work of analytics is intellectually and computationally demanding.
* Machine Learning uses algorithms to discover knowledge in your datasets that you can then apply to help one make informed decisions about the future

**Cases Where Machine Learning Commonly adds value:**
- Segmenting customers and determining the marketing messages that will appeal to different customer groups.
- Discovering anomalies in system and application logs that may be indicative of a cybersecurity incident
- Forecasting product sales based on market and environmental conditions

* ``Artificial Intelligence(AI)`` includes any type of technique whee you are attempting to get a compuer system to imitate human behavior
* ``Machine Learning(ML)`` is a subset of AI techniques,ML techniques attempt to apply statistics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge,ML techniques are AI techniques designed to learn.
* ``Deep Learning`` is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques,known as neural networks ,it is a highly specialized subfield of machine learning that is most commonly used for image and sound analysis.
