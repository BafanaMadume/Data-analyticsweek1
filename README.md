# Data Analytics
Domain of data analytics can be branched into two primary components:
* conceptual understanding of data (theoretical aspect)
* Hands-on manipulation of data (practical aspect)

* The aim is to extract actionable insights and valuable information from data
* What to understand under the Module:
  - Understand what the role of a data analyst is and the scope of data analytics
  - Compare and contrast different data types
  - Compare and contrast common data structures and file formats
  - Learner Assumptions

# What is Data Analytics
so virtually every organization collects large quantities of data about its customers,products,employees and service offerings
* Managers naturally seek to analyze that data and harness the information it contains to improve the efficiency ,effectiveness and profitability of their work>
* So what is the role of a data analyst ,is to **transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making process within the organization**

## 1. Data Collection and Preparation:

* Sourcing Data from various channels,including databases ,spreadsheets and eternal sources
* Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it is accurate consistent and ready for analysis

## 2. Data Analysis
* Employing statistical methods,machine learning techniques ,or other analytic tools to interpret data
* Identifying trends,patterns ,and correlations that might not be obvious

## 3. Data Visualization and Storytelling:
* having to create visual representations of the data,such as charts,graphs and dashboards to make complex information easily understandable
* Articulating findings in a compelling narrative to communicate the significance of data to stakeholders.

## 4. Decision Support
*Making recommendations based on data driven insights to help guide business decisions
* Providing more context around data, including potential implications and future trends.

## 5. Collaboration and Communication
* Working closely with other departments,such as **marketing** ,**finance and operations**,to understand their data needs and provide insights
* Adapting to new types of data and analytical methods as the organization's needs evolve.

A data analyst helps an organization make informed decisions that can improve operational efficiencies ,drive business strategies ,and create a competitive advantage.Goal is to contribute to the organization's success by turning data into valuable assets that informs and drives decision making

* Data analyst posses skills and knowledge required to perform this vital work
  - They often understand how organization can acquire,clean,and transform data to meet the organization's needs.
  - They are able to take the collected information and analyze it using techniques of statistics and machine learning
  - They may then create powerful visualizations that display this data to business leaders,managers and other stakeholders

 # 5 Key points of data analytics

 ### step 1
 process of analyzing raw data to produce useful insights to drive smart business decision,it is kind of business intelligence that can be used to find patterns,example how customers engage with a particualr product.
 ### Step 2 How data analytics is used
 use to make faster and better business decisons

### Step 4: Typical process of a data analyst
##### 5 steps data analyst can take when approaching a new projects

* ``Step 1: Define questions you want to answer=take problem,make hypothesis``
  - what data will I need?
  - Where will it come from?
    
* ``Step 2: Collect the data``
  - gather data from primary sources or from internal data
    - from CRM Software ,Email ,marketing tools
    - can also gather data from secondary sources or external sources
      
* ``Step 3 : Clean the Data``
  - original data might include duplicates ,anamoalies ,missing data,this must be removed
    
* ``Step 4 : Analyze the Data``
  - common analysis include:
    - Regression analysis
    - Cluster analysis
    - Time series analysis

* Data acquisition
* Cleaning and manipulation
* Analysis
* Visualization
* Reporting and communication

#### Analytics  Process is iterative
Steps of the analytics process as aseries of sequential actions,it is more accurate to think of them as aset of interrelated actions that may be revisited frequently while working with a dataset

## Analytics Techniques
As analysts we use variety of techniques to draw conclusions from the data at their disposal.
- ``Descriptive Analytics``
- ``Predictive Analytics``
- ``Prescriptive analytics``

## Machine Learning,Artificial Intelligence,and Deep Learning
* Work of analytics is intellectually and computationally demanding.
* Machine Learning uses algorithms to discover knowledge in your datasets that you can then apply to help one make informed decisions about the future

**Cases Where Machine Learning Commonly adds value:**
- Segmenting customers and determining the marketing messages that will appeal to different customer groups.
- Discovering anomalies in system and application logs that may be indicative of a cybersecurity incident
- Forecasting product sales based on market and environmental conditions

* ``Artificial Intelligence(AI)`` includes any type of technique whee you are attempting to get a compuer system to imitate human behavior
* ``Machine Learning(ML)`` is a subset of AI techniques,ML techniques attempt to apply statistics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge,ML techniques are AI techniques designed to learn.
* ``Deep Learning`` is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques,known as neural networks ,it is a highly specialized subfield of machine learning that is most commonly used for image and sound analysis.

## DATA GOVERNANCE
Data Governance programs ensure that the organization has high-quality data and is able to effectively control that data

## ANALYTICS TOOLS
These tools automate much of the heavy lifting of data analysis,improving the analyst's ability to
* **``acquire``**
* **``clean``**
* **``manipulate``**
* **``visualize and analyze data``**
* **``Invaluable assistance in reporting and communicating results``**

# Chapter 2: Understanding Data
## Exploring Data Types 

* Data element is an attribute about a person,place ,or thing containing data within a range of values.Data elements also describe characteristics of activities ,including orders ,transactions and events.,the column headings name the data element ,while each row is an example value for that format
* Data type limits the values a data element can have ,individual data types support structured,unstructured and semi-structured data

* **1 Tabular Data**
  - tabular data is data organized into a table,made up of columns and rows .a table represents information about a single topic
  - Each **``column``** represents a uniquely named field within a table,also called a variable,about a single characteristics,contents of each column contain values for the data element as defined by the column header
  - Each **``row``** represents a record of a single instance of the table's topic
* Tabular data as rectangular ,meaning it is easier to to draw a rectangle around.top of the rectangle is defined by columns,while rows define the left side of the rectangle,and the intersection of a row and colum contains a specific value.
* Microsoft Excel ,google sheets, and apple numbers are practical tools for presenting tabular data
* Relational Database management system(RDMS), commonly called a database extends the tabular model wherby instead of having all data in a single table,a database organisez related data across multiple tables
* Instead of having all data in a single table,a database organizes related data across multiple tables
* The connection between tables is known as a relationship.Oracle,Microsoft SQL server,MySQL, and PostgreSQL are some examples of database software
* Tabular data is the concept that underpins both spreadsheets and relational databases

## STRUCTURED DATA TYPES
* Structured data is tabular in nature and is organized into rows and columns,Structured data is what typically comes to mind when looking at a spreadsheet
* Structured data is what typically comes to mind when looking at a spreadsheet.With clearly defined columnn,headings,spreadsheets are easy to work with and easy to understand,so in a spreadsheet cells are where rows and colums intersect.

## Common Data Types that give structured data its structure 

## Character
character data type limits data entry to only valid characters .Characters can include the alphabet that you might see on your keyboard,as well as numbers.So depending on your needs multiple data types are available that can enforce character limits

* **ALPHANUMERIC** is the most widely used data type for strong character based data,alphanumeric is appropriate when a data element consists of both numbers and letters
* Alphanumeric data type is ideal for storing product stock-keeping units (SKUs),skus are common for retail clothing space
* one practical use of the text data type is to improve the overall data quality

## Character Sets
* We need to think about the character set we are using to input and store data when using a database.
* **Database use character sets to map,or encode,data and store it digitally**
* The ASCII encoding standard is based on the U.S English alphabet,it accommodates both the upper and lowercase English alphabet and numbers,mathematical operators and symbols
* one of the most commonis unicode Transormation Format-8(UTF-8), it allows non latin characters to be input by a user and stored in a file or database

## DATA TYPE
#### NUMBERS
* When numbers exclusively make up values for a data attribute,numeric becomes the data type of choice
* This data type appears to be simple and obvious based on its name.
* Databases accommodate two types of numeric data types:integar and numeric.

#### Whole Numbers
* The integar and all its subtypes are for storing whole numbers
* The bit data type is intended for storing the status of a flag.

#### Rational Numbers
* The numeric data type is for rational numbers that include a decimal point.
* As with integar family of data types,each database vendor has its implementation nuances
* must take several factors into account when dealing with rational numbers.in both SQL Server and MySQL,there is a data type called numeric that is functionally equivalent to the decimal data type.

#### Date and Time
* Gathered together under the broad category of date,day of year and time of day are data elements that appear with great frequency
![Screenshot 2024-04-09 155648](https://github.com/BafanaMadume/Data-analyticsweek1/assets/141032267/c11885dd-4420-4782-ba73-f6da01f04316)

## Strong and Weak Typing
* Data Types define values placed in columns,Strong typing is when technology rigidly enforces data types.A database column defined as numeric only accepts numerical values
* Weak Typing loosely enforces data types ,spreadsheets use weak typing to help make it easier for people to finish their work,
* Spreadsheets default to an "automatic" data type and accommodate practically any value

# Unstructured data TYPES
* UNSTRUCTURED DATA is any type of data that does not fit neatly into the tabular model
* Examples of unstructured data include:
  - Digital images
  - audio recordings
  - video recordings
  - open-ended survey responses
* Analyzing unstructured data creates a wealth of information and insight.
* Unstructured data type:
* **``Binary``**
  - most common data types for storing unstructure data.It supports any type of digital file you may have Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to digital photographs.
  - When considering which binary data type to use ,file size tends to be the limiting factor.
  - We need to select a data type that is as large as the largest file you plan on storing

* **``Audio``**
  - it can come from variety of sources
  - The impact of capturing,storing,and analyzing audio data has led to the development of avalanche detection systems,These systems listen for and detect the acoustic characteristics of an avalanche,with real time notification capabilities,these systems reduces time it takes for emergency services to respond and alert hikers to treacherous condition
  - Audio can be stored in its raw form which consumes most storage space.
  - alternatively it can be encoded with compression algorithm to reduce the amount of space that is required
  - Regardless of it it is in raw or compressed form,storing audio requires a data type designed to handle raw binary data
* **``Images``**
  - image data has applicability across several industries.
  - Resolution is the most significant factor that governs how much space is required to store an image.The greater the resolution the more detail an image contains,and the more storage space it needs
  - Similar to compressing audio data ,there are a variety of ways to encode and store images
  - Storing images in a database requires a data type designed to handle raw binary data such as varbinary or BLOB
* **``Video``**
  - Video data is growing at a similar pace to image data,image processing algorithms examine videos to detect everything from traffic congestion to intruders in the home.
  - Audio data,the resolution has a significant impact on storage a video consumes.Video duration is also another factor that impacts storage size.
* **``Large Text``**
  -oracle currently implents varchar as a synonym for varchar2

# CATEGORIES OF DATA
Semi-structured data represents the space between structured spreadsheets and unstructured videos

### Quantitative vs Qualitative Data
  - Quantitative data consists of numeric values,Data elements whose values come from counting or measuring are Quantitative
  - Quantitative data answers question like "How Many" and "How Much"
  - Qualitative data consists of frequent text values.Data elements whose values describe characteristics,traits and attitudes are all qualitative.

### DISCRETE VS CONTINUOUS DATA
- Numeric data comes in two different forms:discrete and continuous.
- Discrete data is data that represents measurements that can't be subdivided.discrete data is useful when you have things you want to count.
- It's typically represented with bar graphs where each bar represents a specific coun
- When you measure things like height and weight,you are collecting continuous data.
- While whole numbers represent discrete data ,continuous data typically need a decimal point.
- Qualitative data is discrete,but quantitative data can be either discrete or continuous data
- Discrete applies when counting while continuous applies when measuring.
- It's typically visualized with line graphs or histograms, where the line or bars connect smoothly to show the 
  range of possible values
### CATEGORICAL DATA
- Text data with a known ,finite number of categories is categorical,When considering an individual data element.it is possible to determine whether or not it is categorical
- Categorical data, also known as qualitative data, is a different breed compared to discrete and continuous 
  data. It doesn't deal with numbers representing quantities, but rather categorizes things based on qualities 
  or labels
- You can also use categories to enforce data validation when someone is first entering data.
- Category enforcement has the effect of improving data quality

### DIMENSIANAL DATA
- Dimensional modeling is an approach to arranging data to facilitate analysis
- Dimensional modeling organizes data into fact tables and dimension tables
- A table holding appointment data would be called a fact table
- Dimensions are tables that contain data about the fact
- Dimensional data contains groupings of individual attributes about a given subject.

## Common Data Structures
data needs to be stored in a consistent ,organized manner.

#### Structured Data
- Tabular data is structured data ,with values stored in a consistent ,defined manner,it is organized into columns and rows.
- Data is consistent when all entries in a column contain the same type of value(this particular method of organization facilitates aggregation)
- Structured data also make summarization easy.
- Structured data does not translate directly to data quality
